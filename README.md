# Thyrd Space!

Our FastAPI backend, and Node.js frontend is live and hosted on Render.

**Backend base URL:** https://third-space.onrender.com

**Frontend URL:** https://third-space-frontend.onrender.com

### Interactive API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive docs. These pages let you explore all available endpoints, see request/response schemas, and even test endpoints directly in the browser.

We're using Render's free tier, so the server **spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity**. The first request after inactivity may take 30-60 seconds to respond while the server wakes up. Subsequent requests will be fast.
